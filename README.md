# Machine-Learning-Based-Corrosion-Prediction-for-Biomedical-Mg-Sn-Alloys

## Description
"This repository contains the research and code for predicting the corrosion behavior of magnesium-tin (Mg-Sn) alloys using machine learning techniques. The study, originally published in 'Materials Today Communications', demonstrates the application of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to accurately forecast the corrosion rates of as-cast Mg-Sn alloys intended for biomedical applications. The repository includes experimental data, preprocessing scripts, model development, and validation code.


## Key features:

##### Prediction of corrosion rates using XGBoost.
##### Analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PD) data.
##### Data for Mg-Sn alloys with different tin compositions (1%, 5%, 10%) and immersion times (24h, 48h, 72h).
##### Detailed methodology for model building and validation.
